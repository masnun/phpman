# PHPMan

PHPMan is a simple command line tool that uses Google's "Feeling Lucky" feature to quickly take you to the most relevant page.

### How to Use? 

* Download `phpman.phar` 
* Make it executable - `chmod a+x phpman.phar`
* Run it - `./phpman.phar array shift`
* Optionally, you can add the executable to your `$PATH` and rename it as `phpman`


### Building from Source

I used <a href="https://github.com/masnun/pharmaker">pharmaker</a> to build out the Phar.
